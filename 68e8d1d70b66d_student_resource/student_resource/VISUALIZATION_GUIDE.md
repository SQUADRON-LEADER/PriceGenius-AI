## 📈 How to Use the Visualizations

### During Training:
1. **Watch the SMAPE curves** - Should decrease over epochs
2. **Check convergence** - If flat, more epochs won't help
3. **Monitor training time** - Balance speed vs accuracy
4. **Compare algorithms** - See which performs best

### After Training:
1. **Review final dashboard** - Understand overall results
2. **Check prediction distribution** - Should be similar to training
3. **Verify statistics** - Look for anomalies
4. **Celebrate winner** - See your best model on the podium!

## 🎯 Key Insights from Visualizations

### What to Look For:

#### ✅ Good Signs:
- SMAPE curves decreasing smoothly
- Predictions similar to training distribution
- No extreme outliers in predictions
- All predictions positive
- Consistent performance across algorithms

#### ⚠️ Warning Signs:
- SMAPE increasing after initial decrease (overfitting)
- Predictions very different from training
- Many extreme outliers
- Negative predictions
- Huge variance between algorithms
