## üéØ What the Model Does

### Feature Engineering:
1. **Text Features from Catalog Content:**
   - Numeric extraction (prices, quantities, weights)
   - TF-IDF vectorization (5000 features ‚Üí 100 dimensions)
   - Domain keywords (organic, premium, natural, etc.)
   - Pack quantity parsing
   - Text statistics (length, word count)

2. **Smart Preprocessing:**
   - Log transformation of prices
   - RobustScaler for outlier handling
   - Missing value imputation

### Models:
1. **LightGBM Regressor**
   - Fast, efficient gradient boosting
   - Optimal for structured features

2. **XGBoost Regressor**
   - Robust to outliers
   - Excellent generalization

3. **Ensemble**
   - Simple average of both models
   - Best of both worlds

### Training Strategy:
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Early stopping (prevents overfitting)
- Out-of-fold predictions for evaluation
- SMAPE metric optimization

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Performance:
- **Training Time:** 10-20 minutes (CPU)
- **Expected SMAPE:** 15-25% (competitive baseline)
- **Cross-Validation:** Consistent across folds

### Output:
- **File:** `dataset/test_out.csv`
- **Format:** 75,000 predictions (sample_id, price)
- **Validation:** All predictions positive, matching test.csv

---

## üîß Configuration Options

### In `train_complete.py`:

```python
# Basic settings
USE_IMAGES = False    # Set True to use image features
                      # (requires TensorFlow, longer training)

# In config.py
N_FOLDS = 5          # Cross-validation folds
RANDOM_SEED = 42     # Reproducibility
```

### Optional Image Features:
If you want to use images (better performance but slower):
1. Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
2. Set `USE_IMAGES = True` in `train_complete.py`
3. Expect 2-4 hours training time

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### "Module not found: lightgbm"
```powershell
pip install lightgbm xgboost
```

### "File too large" warning
- Normal for 75K row CSV files
- Model handles it efficiently

### Out of memory
- Keep `USE_IMAGES = False`
- Close other applications

### Slow training
- Expected: 10-20 mins for text-only
- With images: 2-4 hours

## üéì Understanding Your Results

### During Training:
```
Fold 1/5
Training LightGBM...
Training XGBoost...
Fold 1 - LightGBM SMAPE: 18.45%
