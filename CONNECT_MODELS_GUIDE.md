# 🚀 Connect Your Trained Models to Streamlit App

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Save Your Trained Models
In your Jupyter notebook (`Amazon_ML_Multi_Algorithm_Training.ipynb`), add this cell at the end:

```python
# Save models for Streamlit app
import pickle
import os

# Create models directory
models_dir = "models"
if not os.path.exists(models_dir):
    os.makedirs(models_dir)

try:
    # Save preprocessors
    with open(f"{models_dir}/vectorizer.pkl", 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(vectorizer, f)
    
    with open(f"{models_dir}/svd.pkl", 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(svd, f)
    
    with open(f"{models_dir}/scaler.pkl", 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(scaler, f)
    
    # Save trained models
    for model_name, model in final_models.items():
        filename = f"{model_name.lower().replace(' ', '_')}_model.pkl"
        with open(f"{models_dir}/{filename}", 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(model, f)
    
    # Save ensemble weights
    with open(f"{models_dir}/ensemble_weights.pkl", 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(ensemble_weights, f)
    
    print("✅ All models saved successfully!")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
```

### Step 2: Verify Models Are Saved
Check that these files exist in the `models/` folder:
- `vectorizer.pkl`
- `svd.pkl` 
- `scaler.pkl`
- `lightgbm_model.pkl`
- `xgboost_model.pkl`
- `catboost_model.pkl`
- `random_forest_model.pkl`
- `gradient_boosting_model.pkl`
- `ensemble_weights.pkl`

### Step 3: Restart Streamlit App
1. Stop the current Streamlit app (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run again: `python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
3. Look for "✅ Trained Models Loaded" in the sidebar

## Features of the Updated App

### 🎨 **Improved GUI Design**
- **Amazon Brand Colors**: Orange gradient headers with professional styling
- **Fixed Text Visibility**: Algorithm cards now have proper contrast (dark text on light background)
- **Modern Cards**: Hover effects, shadows, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Works great on different screen sizes

### 🤖 **Model Integration**
- **Real Predictions**: Uses your actual trained LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost models
- **Proper Preprocessing**: Same TF-IDF → SVD → Scaling pipeline as your notebook
- **Accurate Ensemble**: Uses your trained ensemble weights
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows real accuracy scores from your training

### 📊 **Enhanced Features**
- **Model Status Display**: Shows whether trained or fallback models are active
- **Algorithm Performance**: Visual accuracy bars for each model
- **Confidence Scoring**: Based on model agreement and historical performance
- **Processing Insights**: Shows feature count and processing time

### 🎯 **Input Methods**
1. **Manual Entry**: Fill in product details manually
2. **Catalog Content**: Paste Amazon product descriptions (auto-parsed)
3. **Quick Examples**: Pre-loaded product examples for testing

### 📈 **Analytics Dashboard**
- **Price Distribution**: Histogram of training data
- **Category Analysis**: Product category breakdown
- **Prediction History**: Track your prediction patterns
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare model outputs

## Model Performance (From Your Training)

| Algorithm | SMAPE Score | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 🥇 LightGBM | 45.68% | Best |
| 🥈 XGBoost | 45.61% | Very Good |
| 🥉 CatBoost | 44.22% | Good |
| 🌲 Random Forest | 43.85% | Good |
| ⚡ Gradient Boosting | 43.92% | Good |

## Sample Prediction Test

After connecting your models, test with this gaming laptop:
```
Product: High-performance gaming laptop with RTX 4080, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD
Expected Price Range: $2,500 - $4,000
```

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Models not found" 
- Make sure you've run all cells in your training notebook
- Check that the `models/` folder exists with all `.pkl` files
- Verify notebook variables exist: `vectorizer`, `svd`, `scaler`, `final_models`

### ❌ "Fallback Models Active"
- Your models weren't saved properly
- Re-run the model saving cell in your notebook
- Restart the Streamlit app

### ❌ "Prediction Error"
- Check that your models use the same feature dimensions
- Ensure preprocessing steps match your training pipeline
- Verify model compatibility with current scikit-learn version
